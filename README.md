# Mealy machine


The given code is for a tkinter GUI application that simulates a Mealy machine. It allows the user to input a string and a starting state, and then calculates the output string based on the transition and output tables of the Mealy machine.

The application creates a Tkinter window with input fields for the input string and the starting state. It also creates buttons for each possible input symbol (X1, X2, X3) and each possible state (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5, Q6). The user can click on the buttons to insert the corresponding symbols or states into the input field.

The application also creates a "Start!" button, which, when clicked, calculates the output string based on the input string and starting state. The output string is then displayed in a label on the window.

The code uses two dictionaries, "transition_table" and "output_table", to simulate the Mealy machine. The "transition_table" stores the next state for each combination of current state and input symbol, and the "output_table" stores the output symbol for each combination of current state and input symbol.

Overall, the code provides a graphical interface for interacting with a Mealy machine and getting the corresponding output for a given input string and starting state.
